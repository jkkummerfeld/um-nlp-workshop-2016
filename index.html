      <h3>Talk preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Most attendees will give a talk on their current research.
        Faculty, Postdocs, and PhD students will give 10 minute talks.
        Masters and Undergraduate students will give 2 minute lightning talks.
        All talks will be timed, with an iPad displaying your time remaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be using a single laptop on the day for all talks to avoid losing time between speakers.
        The computer will be a Macbook Pro with macOS 10.12, Keynote 7.0.5, and Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac.
        Please set the filename of your presentation to start with your name, e.g. Jane_Doe.key and provide us with BOTH the presentation file and a version that has been exported to PDF.
        We have prepared several talk templates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxm7L4IzTm-WOC1nNWxhZ1ZZakk">Keynote</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxm7L4IzTm-WaWM1M2IwcGlPVFk">Powerpoint</a> </li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/presentation/d/1XOttdRNNXBZ32_VhPN3nPYXIlmJNsCOrqN8IfTH65CU/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Lightning talk specific guidelines</h4>
      <p>
        All lightning talks will be presented as PDFs and contain a title slide and either 1 or 2 content slides.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will allow us to combine them all into one long presentation, saving time on the day.
        The advantage of PDF is that you can use any slide creation program you want, but the downside is that you cannot have complex animation.
        We recommend the three slides be: a title slide, a project description slide, and a results slide.
        If simple animations cause these three slides to become more than three when exported to PDF that's fine.
      </p>

Usage of a product is intimately related to the psychology of a consumer, and it has been observed in Psychology literature that a consumer's self-image correlates with product use. We created a human-annotated gold standard dataset of 565 Amazon reviews spanning five distinct product categories. Our dataset consists of more than 3000 annotated sentences. We introduce a system that classifies sentences according to "usage'' or otherwise. After extensive feature tuning, we came up with a set of simple, robust, scalable, and language-independent features that beat other more complex and language-sensitive features, as well as a hand-crafted decision list baseline by a wide margin. We showed the efficacy of our approach using importance ranking of features.</div>

Personal writings have inspired researchers in the fields of linguistics and psychology to study the relationship between language and culture to better understand the psychology of people across different cultures. In this paper, we explore this relation by developing cross-cultural word models to identify words with cultural bias – i.e., words that are used in significantly different ways by speakers from different cultures. Focusing specifically on two cultures: United States and Australia, we identify a set of words with significant usage difference, and further investigate these words through feature analysis and topic modeling, shedding light on the attributes of language that contribute to these differences.</div>

We then use correlation techniques to analyze the relationship between these attributes and user dimensions, concluding that images do indeed provide us substantial information about the people who post them.</div></td>

Semantic parsers have recently been used to generate graph representations from sentences using abstract meaning representation (AMR). One of the highest performing systems over the past few years, CAMR, uses a transition based method to convert a dependency parse into an AMR graph. Our work focuses on improving this system in two ways. First, we have changed the learning method from an averaged perceptron to a logistic regression model trained with a max-margin objective function which has been shown to improve performance in previous parsing work. Second, we intend to incorporate features in transition classification that contain world knowledge. This entails the generation of these features from various corpora and a modification to the model to allow it to take advantage of continuous valued features.</div>
<a href="#mycollapse11" data-toggle="collapse">Deep Memory Networks for Attitude Identification</a><div style="max-width:400px" id="mycollapse11" class="collapse">
We consider the task of identifying attitude towards a given set of entities from text. Conventionally, this task is decomposed into two separate subtasks: target detection that identifies whether each entity is mentioned either explicitly or implicitly in the text, and polarity classification that classifies the exact sentiment towards an identified entity (the target) into either positive, negative, or neutral

Instead, we show that attitude identification can be solved with an end-to-end machine learning architecture, with the two subtasks interleaved by a deep memory network. In this way, signals produced in target detection provide clues to polarity classification, and reversely, polarity provides feedback to the first subtask. Moreover, the treatments of the set of targets also influence each other -- the learned representations may share the same semantics for many targets but vary for some targets. The proposed deep memory network outperforms models that do not consider the interactions between the subtasks or among the targets, including conventional methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning models. </div>
<a href="#mycollapse12" data-toggle="collapse">Cultural Influences on the Measurement of Personal Values through Words</a><div style="max-width:400px" id="mycollapse12" class="collapse">
The ever-growing collection of publicly accessible web data continually provides new and exciting opportunities to study how people are thinking, behaving, and feeling. We can now study psychological traits and their links to behaviors on a larger scale than ever before through the analysis of social media data. However, it is important to consider that when collecting samples from diverse people groups, culture may have a strong influence on the results and their interpretation.  Cultural groups differ not only in the way that they use language, but also in their personal values and everyday behaviors. We use a computational content analytic approach to examine the connections between people’s core values and everyday behaviors with the aim of exploring the role a person’s cultural background plays in these value-behavior relationships. Our results show that a topic modeling approach can be used to investigate the role that geographic location plays in value-behavior relationships, and how the cultural background of writers can affect the conclusions being made in computational sociolinguistic studies.</div></td>

In this work, we studied the problem of classifying symptom severity from neuropsychiatric clinical records using supervised machine learning approaches. The data is released as part of the Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale NLP challenge 2016 organized by i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside), a NIH-funded national center at Partners Health Care System. The participants of the shared task are provided with the raw clinical notes from the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients. The patient records in the training data are categorized into four classes, viz., absent, mild, moderate, and severe. As part of our investigation, we explored features derived from the template-based text in the clinical notes, a medical thesauri such as UMLS, and corpus-based weighting in the training set. A Random Forest classifier is trained on this feature sets to classify the test samples. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy.</div>

We focus on the task of response selection for the retrieval-based conversation agents by modeling unstructured, multi-turn, two-party dialogs.  Current response selection approaches are limited to small contexts and view the multi-turn context as a long sequence of words.  Motivated by this observation, we propose Interleaving-Thoughts Recurrent Neural Network (IT-RNN).  Our model constructs representations for individual utterances via low-level networks, and then high-level layers produces intrinsic dynamics of conversations via intention flows and information exchanges.  This enables neural networks to deal with arbitrary lengths of conversation history and catch discourse information and utterance dependency among two speakers.  We build IT-RNN on top of vanilla RNN, GRU, and LSTM units.  We evaluate our model on two public available multi-turn dialog corpora.  Experimental results show that our system significantly outperforms traditional Information Retrieval methods and other neural network baselines.</div></td>
