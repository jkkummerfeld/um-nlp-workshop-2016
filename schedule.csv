Shibamouli Lahiri,PhD talk,1:53 PM,2:04 PM,0:11:00,Identifying Usage Expression Sentences in Product Reviews,"Usage of a product is intimately related to the psychology of a consumer, and it has been observed in Psychology literature that a consumer's self-image correlates with product use. We created a human-annotated gold standard dataset of 565 Amazon reviews spanning five distinct product categories. Our dataset consists of more than 3000 annotated sentences. We introduce a system that classifies sentences according to ""usage'' or otherwise. After extensive feature tuning, we came up with a set of simple, robust, scalable, and language-independent features that beat other more complex and language-sensitive features, as well as a hand-crafted decision list baseline by a wide margin. We showed the efficacy of our approach using importance ranking of features.",,,,,,n,n,5,LIT

Charles Welch,PhD talk,3:51 PM,4:02 PM,0:11:00,AMR Semantic Parsing with World Knowledge,"Semantic parsers have recently been used to generate graph representations from sentences using abstract meaning representation (AMR). One of the highest performing systems over the past few years, CAMR, uses a transition based method to convert a dependency parse into an AMR graph. Our work focuses on improving this system in two ways. First, we have changed the learning method from an averaged perceptron to a logistic regression model trained with a max-margin objective function which has been shown to improve performance in previous parsing work. Second, we intend to incorporate features in transition classification that contain world knowledge. This entails the generation of these features from various corpora and a modification to the model to allow it to take advantage of continuous valued features.",,,,,,,,4,LIT

Qiaozhu Mei / Cheng Li,PhD talk,4:13 PM,4:24 PM,0:11:00,Deep Memory Networks for Attitude Identification,"We consider the task of identifying attitude towards a given set of entities from text. Conventionally, this task is decomposed into two separate subtasks: target detection that identifies whether each entity is mentioned either explicitly or implicitly in the text, and polarity classification that classifies the exact sentiment towards an identified entity (the target) into either positive, negative, or neutral

Instead, we show that attitude identification can be solved with an end-to-end machine learning architecture, with the two subtasks interleaved by a deep memory network. In this way, signals produced in target detection provide clues to polarity classification, and reversely, polarity provides feedback to the first subtask. Moreover, the treatments of the set of targets also influence each other -- the learned representations may share the same semantics for many targets but vary for some targets. The proposed deep memory network outperforms models that do not consider the interactions between the subtasks or among the targets, including conventional methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning models.

First, data collection can be expensive and difficult, particularly when experts are required. We are exploring a way to expand a dataset using non-experts to paraphrase an initial set of data. Second, I will describe work on extending my graph parsing algorithm beyond constituency parsing to cover AMR, which involves novel approaches to learning without an alignment between the sentence and the abstract structure.",,,,,,,,-,-
Tanmay Basu,Postdoc talk,5:29 PM,5:40 PM,0:11:00,Identifying Severity in Neuropsychiatric Clinical Notes,"In this work, we studied the problem of classifying symptom severity from neuropsychiatric clinical records using supervised machine learning approaches. The data is released as part of the Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale NLP challenge 2016 organized by i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside), a NIH-funded national center at Partners Health Care System. The participants of the shared task are provided with the raw clinical notes from the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients. The patient records in the training data are categorized into four classes, viz., absent, mild, moderate, and severe. As part of our investigation, we explored features derived from the template-based text in the clinical notes, a medical thesauri such as UMLS, and corpus-based weighting in the training set. A Random Forest classifier is trained on this feature sets to classify the test samples. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy.",n,n,n,n,,,,-,

We follow a multimodal approach in order to integrate discriminative features that are more capable of indicating the corresponding behavior.

Mahmoud Azab,PhD talk,5:51 PM,6:02 PM,0:11:00,Structured Matching for Phrase Localization,We introduce a new approach to phrase localization: grounding phrases in sentences to image regions. We propose a structured matching of phrases and regions that encourages the semantic relations between phrases to agree with the visual relations between regions.  We integrate structured matching with neural networks to enable end-to-end training. We evaluate the model on Flickr30K Entities dataset.,n,n,,,,,,3,LIT

We need semantic technologies capable of identifying and organizing knowledge encoded in the text to support these complex needs. We need to develop structured representations that go beyond current efforts to curate knowledge about entities and relations. We also need effective and expressive query mechanisms that provide declarative access to this knowledge.,,,,,,,,3,-
Steven Wilson,PhD talk,6:13 PM,6:24 PM,0:11:00,Cultural Influences on the Measurement of Personal Values through Words,"The ever-growing collection of publicly accessible web data continually provides new and exciting opportunities to study how people are thinking, behaving, and feeling. We can now study psychological traits and their links to behaviors on a larger scale than ever before through the analysis of social media data. However, it is important to consider that when collecting samples from diverse people groups, culture may have a strong influence on the results and their interpretation.  Cultural groups differ not only in the way that they use language, but also in their personal values and everyday behaviors. We use a computational content analytic approach to examine the connections between people’s core values and everyday behaviors with the aim of exploring the role a person’s cultural background plays in these value-behavior relationships. Our results show that a topic modeling approach can be used to investigate the role that geographic location plays in value-behavior relationships, and how the cultural background of writers can affect the conclusions being made in computational sociolinguistic studies.",,,,,,,,4,LIT
Rui Zhang,PhD talk,6:24 PM,6:35 PM,0:11:00,Interleaving Speaker Thoughts via RNNs in Multi-Turn Dialogs,"We focus on the task of response selection for the retrieval-based conversation agents by modeling unstructured, multi-turn, two-party dialogs.  Current response selection approaches are limited to small contexts and view the multi-turn context as a long sequence of words.  Motivated by this observation, we propose Interleaving-Thoughts Recurrent Neural Network (IT-RNN).  Our model constructs representations for individual utterances via low-level networks, and then high-level layers produces intrinsic dynamics of conversations via intention flows and information exchanges.  This enables neural networks to deal with arbitrary lengths of conversation history and catch discourse information and utterance dependency among two speakers.  We build IT-RNN on top of vanilla RNN, GRU, and LSTM units.  We evaluate our model on two public available multi-turn dialog corpora.  Experimental results show that our system significantly outperforms traditional Information Retrieval methods and other neural network baselines.",,,n,n,n,,,2,CLAIR

The template-based system for converting NL queries to MySQL queries is being built as part of IBM Project Sapphire, for scenarios where the student asks questions whose the answers can be looked up from a database. For example, a question like ""What courses are being offered next semester?"" can be looked up from a database and the answers given to the student. The system was originally was built by the research group of Jagadish H.V. In this project, we are working on adapting the system for the course advising domain and adding statistical methods to improve the performance of the system in this domain.",,,,,,,,,
